#Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the DNS server you're using
cat /var/run/resolv.conf

#This file contains the IP address of the DNS i'm using
#We can also see the IP with following command:
#cat /etc/resolv.conf
#BUT if we would use "ls -la" on that file it would say that it's linked to the /var/run/resolv.conf
