#Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85

#We can make it, if we are going to modify the file /private/etc/hosts (from a previous question)
#And add to the file something like that:
#"46.19.122.85		intra.42.fr"
#This will give us rerouting, though we can't test, because don't have enough rights
